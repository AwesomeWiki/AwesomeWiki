# AwesomeWiki Developer Guide

This repository contains two major software components that power AwesomeWiki. The first is **AwesomeWiki Core,** which is the database and API that provide AwesomeWiki's primary functionality. The second is **AwesomeWiki MVP 1,** which is a demo application built on top of AwesomeWiki Core, to showcase how developers can use AwesomeWiki to build their own applications.
